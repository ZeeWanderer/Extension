# SpriteKit Scene Capture

Capture `SKScene` output as `UIImage` during gameplay and debugging sessions.

## Overview

SpriteKitExtension adds screenshot helpers on `SKScene` when running under UIKit. Use `screenShot` for the scene's rendered output and `screenShot_composite` when you need a composite that includes the surrounding UIKit view hierarchy.
