# ``SwiftUIExtension``

SwiftUI utilities for layout, view modifiers, SpriteKit bridging, and environment helpers.

## Overview

SwiftUIExtension focuses on pragmatic UI plumbing: convenience views, timeline helpers, keyboard height tracking, and lightweight extensions to common SwiftUI types like `View`, `Color`, `GeometryProxy`, and `UnitPoint`. It is designed to be dropped into app targets without introducing view framework coupling elsewhere.
